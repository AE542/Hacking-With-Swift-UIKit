//before starting on building games using SpriteKit, remember the clean up first
// delete actions.sks
// delete hello world from game scene change the width and height to 1024 x 768
// delete all the code in this class as you won't use it, only for demo purposes. Leave override func add touches began method.
//add image files from folder then remember that sound files should be seperate and added below info.plist but not in the assets folder.
