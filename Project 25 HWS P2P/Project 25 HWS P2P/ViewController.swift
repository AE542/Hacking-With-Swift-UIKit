//Rundown;
//We deleted the original vc in storybaords and added a collectionView vc. Embed in a navVC, set re-use ids and make sure the class is set to ViewController in the identity inspector.
//Then in the attributes inspector we changed the collection view's section insets to 10 for top, left, bottom and right. Added a UIImage view to the collection view cell. Then set the image views tag in the attributes inspector to 1000. After that select the collection view go to editor, resolve autolayout issues and reset to suggested constraints.
